## The Process

1. Define the dream outcome
2. List *all* the client's possible problems
3. Split each problem based on the value equation
4. Convert problems into solution wording i.e. it will be to hard -> how to make it less hard
5. Think of solutions using the delivery cube
6. Determine if each solution is high value or low value, and high cost or low cost
7. Make sure each problem has a solution, if a problem has multiple solutions choose the higher value one
8. Reserve the hardest hitting high value, high cost items (max 2 or 3)

## Chapters

## 1. Markets

### Needs to have

'Help a unique avatar. Solve a specific problem. In a unique way. That reverses their biggest fear or objection.'

'The riches are in the niches -> Same product x100 price.'

'The goal of great *writing* is for the reader *to understand*.'

'The goal of great *copy* is for the reader *to feel understood*'

## 2. Pricing

### Price to value discrepancy

Price is what you *pay*, value is what you *get*

If perceived *value* > price = happy customer

Therefore 2 options:

1. Increase value (easier unlimited up)
2. Decrease price (harder limited to 0)

### Virtuous pricing cycle

Normally:

- Pick below the highest competitor to "be competitive"
- Value proposition -> more for less
- Pricing for market efficiency -> race to the bottom

### Charge what it's worth - new price

- Make price so disconnected from market that people pause
- Higher price = higher value e.g. wine example
- *Must be something different* - category of one
- Higher prices get people better results

## 3. Value Equation

1. *Dream outcome* - Is the end result meaningful *to them*
2. *Perceived likelihood* - Risk reduction/Credibility
3. *Time delay* - how long will it take for the final result/progress. (Incorporate short term immediate wins)
4. *Effort or sacrifice* - how can I make it easier

## 4. The delivery vehicle - 'the how'

- Define Their Dream Outcome
- List out Every Possible Problem they can Encounter
  - Every intricate step
  - Everything that happens before and after achieving their goals
  - What next problem will they face
  - How can we make it worth it?
  - How can we make it easier?
  - How can we make it faster?
  - How can we make it enjoyable, sustainable, and something they believe they can do?
- List out every possible solution to the problems
  - How to YAY without BOO even if you GREATEST OBSTACLE
- Use Delivery Cube to think thorough ideas

## 5. Trim and stack

### Maximise profit value

- Rate each solution based on value and cost
- Cut everything that's low value

### Final stack of high value, high profit

- Stack solutions, choose most valuable if they solve the same problem
- Every single problem should be solved
- Limit the number of high value, high cost items to the hardest hitting
- Start with something that is less scalable (more high cost high value) to get people to say yes
and begin monetization

#### Defining value

When defining value for each solution *reverse the value equation*

#### Defining cost

Should be 80% or higher gross margin

### Together

- List all problems
- Rate cost & value
- Remove low value items
